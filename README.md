# Hi!

I'm Billy Reynolds, a math enthusiast and self-taught programmer.  I began my academic career studying purely mathematics at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, focusing on Real
Analysis with a personal interest in Dynamical Systems.  After completing my undergrad, I found my options with a pure math degree to be very limited without any supplementary skills.  
On a whim, I started learning python and quickly realized I'd been missing out on a whole other world of fascinating problems and opportunities.  Since then, I've picked up several other 
languages: Python, Javascript (including JQuery), C++/C#, Java, and perhaps more since this file has been updated.  

# This project... 
serves as a gallery of some of my projects, the first of which is the design of the website itself!  Take a look at them and feel free to contact me with any comments, bugs, or features you'd like to see!
